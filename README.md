# EvolverGradientModel

### This repository contains the source files for Surface Evolver simulations for the publication, 'Effect of initial variance of microstructures on grain growth under mean curvature' (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-651X/aa763c/meta) 

### The geometrical coordinates for the vertices, edges, and facets were created by a Voronoi tesselation carried out in Mathematica.
